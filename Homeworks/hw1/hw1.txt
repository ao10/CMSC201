Question 1:
1.If the number is greater than 2, divide it by 2
2.If the number is 2 or is divided evenly by 2 then it is not a prime number
3.If the number does not divide evenly by 2 then
3.5 Store the number in a variable called "num"
4.Subtract num by 1 and divide num by that number
5.Repeat until num is divided evenly by a number other than 1 or itself
6.If num is not divided evenly by any numbers other than 1 or itself it is a prime number.

Question 2:
1.Store the palindrome in a variable called "word1"
2.Rewrite the palindrome backwards and store it in a variable called "word2"
3.Go through word1 and word2 checking each letter simultaneously
4.If the current letter in word1 does not match word2 it is not a palindrome
5.If the test goes through with all letters in word1 and word2 equal to eachother it is a palindrome

Question 3:
1.Start at the first notecard
2.Create a variable called "lowest"
3.Store the first notecard in "lowest"
4.Compare "lowest" to the next card using the (>) greater-than operator
5.If "lowest" is higher than the card its being compared to, store that card in "lowest"
6.Repeat from step 4 until you have compared all the notecards

Question 4:
1.Store the current number in a variable called "factorial"
2.Subtract 1 from factorial and multiply that number by "factorial"
3.Store that number in a variable called "currentTotal"
4.Repeat from step 2 until "factorial" is equal to 1.
