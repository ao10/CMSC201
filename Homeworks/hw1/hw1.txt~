3.Go through word1 and word2 checking each letter simultaneously
4.If the current letter in word1 does not match word2 it is not a palindrome

Question 3:
1.Start at the first notecard

3.Store the first notecard in "lowest"

6.Repeat from step 4 until you have compared all the notecards



Question 4:
1.Store the current number in a variable called "factorial"
2.Subtract 1 from factorial and multiply that number by "factorial"
3.Store that number in a variable called "currentTotal"
4.Repeat from step 2 until "factorial" is equal to 1.
