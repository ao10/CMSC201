# Description:
#   This file contains python code that implements lab5 (a 
#   TV show voting system) using functions to:
#   1) Get a choice
#   2) Find the name of the winner

STOP = 0

# getVote() returns a valid choice from the given list
# Input:    showList, a list of strings (names of shows to vote on)
# Output:   vote,     an integer containing a choice between 0 and list length
#          *reprompts user until valid choice is made*
def getVote(showList):

        vote = int(input("Enter '0 to stop voting: "))
    return vote
    


# getWinner() takes in a list of shows and votes and calculates the winner
# Input:      showList, a list of strings (names of shows to vote on)
#             votes,    a list of integers (votes for each show)
# Output:     whoWon,   the name of the show that won with the most votes
#             *in case of a tie, the first show seen in the list wins*
